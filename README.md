## Getting Started

This project is a Rick and Morty project.
Here you can search for any officially available character, filter them by gender, race, name, etc.; see their details (name, origin, etc.); add to your favorites.

Offline available for characters screen only for now. (Can't use character details screen for now without internet connection, because it fetches character by id from api)
Added profile screen, where you can login or register in the app.
Update profile: add calls to own api (adding, removing, fetching all favourite characters).
Added ability to generate random picture for every user (like on Github).
Added token checks and generation both on be and mobile.
Added ability to share favourite char.
Added fully generated fiction news about rick and morty.
Moved the whole app on the localhost rails, so no 3rd party api's are needed.

Soonly I hope posting BE to docker containers (so you can have your own copy of be app) or unwrap the whole project on AWS/GCP, so you could use my own extended API.

To be updated.
