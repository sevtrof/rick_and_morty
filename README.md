## Getting Started

This project is a Rick and Morty project.
Here you can search for any officially available character, filter them by gender, race, name, etc.; see their details (name, origin, etc.); add to your favorites.

Offline available for characters screen only for now. (Can't use character details screen for now without internet connection, because it fetches character by id from api)
Added profile screen, where you can login or register in the app (currently updating my rick_and_morty_be project so you can login and register).
Soonly I hope posting BE to docker containers (so you can have your own copy of be app) or unwrap the whole project on AWS/GCP, so you could use my own extended API.

To be updated.
